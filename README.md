# py-searchable-audio
Transcribe audio files and make them searchable.

This project is a demo for my article at medium.com

## How to run this project:

1. Install the necessary libs from the requirements.txt
2. Download the .wav samples or put your own data in the project's directory. Don't forget to adjust the recognition language if it is other than English!
3. Run the program with python/python3.
